##Dataset
This project uses the Titanic dataset (CSV format). The dataset contains passenger information such as passenger class, gender, age, family members, ticket details, fare, and embarkation port, along with the target variable Survived, which indicates whether a passenger survived or not.

##Machine Learning Problem

This is a classification problem. The goal is to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster (Survived = Yes/No) based on the available features in the dataset.
